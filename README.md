# Face and Eye Detection Project

This project allows you to detect faces or eyes in real-time using OpenCV. Users can easily switch between face and eye detection modes by modifying the code ---faces=detect_faces(frame)-- changing this line with ---detect_eyes(frame)--- if code could not find the cascade files, write full path .

## Features
- Detect faces using Haar cascades.
- Detect eyes within Haar cascades.
